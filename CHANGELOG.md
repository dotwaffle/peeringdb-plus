## [Unreleased] — v1.16

v1.16 is a coordinated milestone release. Phases 67, 68, 69, 70, and 71 ship
together in a single deploy window; Phase 72 (upstream parity regression) may
follow independently. Do not deploy any individual Phase 68 commit in
isolation — pdbcompat `?limit=0` now returns all matching rows, and the
memory-safe response paths that bound that behaviour land in Phase 71.

### Breaking

- **Removed `PDBPLUS_INCLUDE_DELETED` environment variable.** Sync now
  always persists deleted rows as tombstones (soft-delete via
  `UPDATE ... SET status='deleted'`). During the v1.16 → v1.17 grace
  period, setting this variable triggers a startup WARN and is ignored;
  v1.17 upgrades this to a fatal startup error. Remove it from your
  environment. See
  [`docs/CONFIGURATION.md` § Removed in v1.16](./docs/CONFIGURATION.md#removed-in-v116).

  **One-time gap:** Rows hard-deleted by sync cycles BEFORE the v1.16
  upgrade are gone forever. `?status=deleted` and `?since=N` queries
  populate going forward from the first post-upgrade sync cycle. See
  [`docs/API.md` § Known Divergences](./docs/API.md#known-divergences).

### Added

- **pdbcompat status × since matrix** matching upstream
  `peeringdb_server/rest.py:694-727`. List requests without `?since`
  return only `status=ok`. List requests with `?since=N` admit
  `(ok, deleted)`, plus `pending` for campus. Single-object GETs
  (`/api/<type>/<id>`) admit `(ok, pending)` for all 13 entity types.
  Explicit `?status=deleted` on a list request without `?since`
  silently returns an empty set, matching the upstream unconditional
  `filter(status='ok')` on `rest.py:725`.

- **pdbcompat `?limit=0` semantics** match upstream `rest.py:734-737`:
  an explicit `limit=0` returns all matching rows. The default-when-unset
  remains `250`. `?depth=` on list endpoints is silently ignored in
  Phase 68; Phase 71 will add list+depth support with the
  `API_DEPTH_ROW_LIMIT=250` cap.

- **pdbcompat cross-surface default ordering** flipped to
  `(-updated, -created, -id)` (Phase 67, shipped earlier in v1.16).
  Applies to pdbcompat `/api/`, entrest `/rest/v1/`, ConnectRPC list
  RPCs, and GraphQL list queries. Single-object lookups and nested
  `_set` fields are unchanged.

### Changed

- **Sync now soft-deletes** instead of hard-deleting. The 13
  `deleteStale*` functions in `internal/sync/delete.go` were renamed
  to `markStaleDeleted*`; they run
  `UPDATE ... SET status='deleted', updated=<cycle_start>` per sync
  cycle. One `cycleStart` timestamp is stamped on every tombstone
  within a cycle so `?since=N` windows stay atomic. Tombstone
  garbage-collection policy is deferred to SEED-004 (planted
  2026-04-19).

### Deprecated

- `PDBPLUS_INCLUDE_DELETED` (see Breaking above; removal completes
  with fatal startup error in v1.17).

### Fixed

- `?limit=0` on pdbcompat list endpoints previously fell back to
  `DefaultLimit=250`. Now returns all rows up to any other filter,
  matching upstream behaviour (`rest.py:734-737`).
